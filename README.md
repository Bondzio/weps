# Web People Search (WePS) evaluation campaign

## Introduction

This repository contains resources for the three WePS evaluation campaigns. It includes the original data sets and gold standard so that researchers in person name disambiguation, clustering and attribute extraction can benchmark their approach to the tasks defined on these competitive campaigns.

## WePS-1
The First Web People Search Evaluation Campaign (WePS-1) was held on June 23-24, 2007 in association with Semeval/ACL 2007 in Prague, Czech Republic.

### Organized by:
* [Javier Artiles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javierartiles), [NLP & IR Group (UNED)](http://nlp.uned.es/)
* [Julio Gonzalo](http://nlp.uned.es/~julio), [NLP & IR Group (UNED)](http://nlp.uned.es/)
* [Satoshi Sekine](http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/sekine/index.html), [Proteus Project (NYU)](http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/)

### Task summary
This task focuses on the disambiguation of person names in a Web searching scenario. Finding people, information about people, in the World Wide Web is one of the most common activities of Internet users. Person names, however, are highly ambiguous. In most cases, therefore, the results for this type of search are a mixture of pages about different people that share the same name.

The participant's systems will receive as input, web pages retrieved from a web search engine using a given person name as a query. The aim of the task is to determine how many referents (different people) exist for that person name, and assign to each referent its corresponding documents. The challenge is to correctly estimate the number of referents and group documents referring to the same individual.
